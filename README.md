# MedicalSchedulingApp
This app was made for a Mobile Apps course. There are two main proponents to this app: the ability for the user to view the hospitals, 
urgent cares, and mental health clinics closest to the user's closest location. Furthermore, a user can keep track of their appointments at
these places. The user can add, delete, edit, and update appointments.

The technologies used in this project were Android SDK, Java, and Kotlin for the business logic, Firebase for storing user records, and Mapbox SDK
for displaying the map and the locations of medical centers.

Note that since personal data is involved, using Firebase is a temporary solution, as it would not be HIPAA compliant.
